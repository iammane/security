## Windows Setup

Rather than relying on only a Linux VM to use all the tooling I'm considering a hybrid approach. A lot of tools are cross platform and I feel using the ones available to Windows natively is a win (ie, NMAP, BurpSuite). WSL allows us to run a Linux variant (including Kali) directly on top of Windows without needing to use a hypervisor thick client like VMware or Virtual Box. The guide linked above will contain some setup steps and considerations!
